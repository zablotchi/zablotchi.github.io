I am a PhD student in the [Distributed Computing Laboratory](https://dcl.epfl.ch/site/) at EPFL. My advisor is [Rachid Guerraoui](http://lpdwww.epfl.ch/rachid/). My PhD work has been supported in part by an [ERC grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/339539).

My research focuses on the theory and practice of concurrent algorithms. I am most interested on the impact of emerging technologies, such as RDMA and persistent memory, on the way that we build distributed systems.
