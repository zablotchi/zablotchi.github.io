I am a postdoctoral fellow in [Nir Shavit](https://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/)'s group at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). My research is generously supported by a [SNSF Early Postdoc.Mobility](https://www.snf.ch/en/f6JZyI4uQ1mNeq3J/funding/funding/discontinued-funding-schemes/early-postdoc-mobility) fellowship. 

Prior to joining MIT, I completed my PhD in the [Distributed Computing Laboratory](https://dcl.epfl.ch/site/) at EPFL. I was advised by [Rachid Guerraoui](http://lpdwww.epfl.ch/rachid/). My PhD work was supported in part by an [ERC grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/339539). My [dissertation](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/281678?ln=en) was awarded an Honorable Mention for the [EuroSys Needham PhD Award](https://www.eurosys.org/awards/needham-award), as well as an [EPFL Thesis Distinction](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/phd-awards/thesis-distinction/).

My current research focuses on deep learning, specifically on ways to learn with less data, and on efficiently leveraging very large deep learning models. I am also interested in the theory and practice of shared memory algorithms. My research has explored the impact of emerging technologies, such as RDMA and persistent memory, on the way that we build distributed systems.
